# Employee UI

I was given a timed skills assessment which included a task to create a UI to show a list of employees, consuming a very simple API (provided), with search and sort functionality.

They said my result was "above threshold", but *I* wasn't happy with my result. So, I recreated the task and started the solution from scratch. This is the result.

To implement the API, run `node server.js`
